Default Encryption (Automatic by Snowflake)

All data stored in Snowflake tables is automatically encrypted using strong AES-256 encryption.

Data in transit (between client and Snowflake) is protected using TLS.

Hierarchical Key Management: Snowflake uses a multi-level key hierarchy (root keys, account master keys, table master keys, file keys) to manage encryption and key rotation.

You do not need to manually enable encryption for your tables, schemas, or databasesâ€”this is always on.
